Why This Project Exists (and Who We Are)

---

## 0. Spirit of the Project

This is a toy geometric construction built from integers, bit operations, and curiosity.
It's not research.
It's not a conjecture.
It's not an attempt to discover properties of primes.

It's closer to:
- a kid pointing a toy telescope at the sky
- an astrophotographer taking long exposures for fun
- a programmer rotating a cube just to see the shadows

The joy is in looking — not proving.

1. What This Project Is
	•	A visualization
	•	A deterministic geometry built purely from integer operations
	•	A way to explore 2-adic structure visually
	•	A playground for GPU-based rendering
	•	A curiosity-driven artifact

⸻

2. What This Project Is Not
	•	Not NASA
	•	Not analytic number theory
	•	Not claiming significance
	•	Not discovering prime patterns
	•	Not proposing new mathematics
	•	Not making conjectures

⸻

3. Approaching Patterns Responsibly

If something “looks interesting”:
	•	check random order
	•	check shell order
	•	check theta order
	•	compare with shuffled baselines
	•	assume artifacts until proven otherwise

Always maintain humility.
This is a sandbox, not a telescope array.

⸻

4. Why We Keep Building

Because:
	•	discrete geometry is beautiful
	•	integer structures are fascinating
	•	bitwise orderings have aesthetic symmetry
	•	GPUs make it cheap to explore
	•	something visually surprising may appear

Maybe we see nothing.
Maybe we see something.
Either way, the looking is the point.
